#Internet is not just port 80 _(draft)_

A dominance of English language spreading world-wide is quite evidential nowadays. The interconnected network founded and spread recently (roughly in past 20 years) made this fact even more manifest.

All this we know already, but there is something notable underlying this strange phenomena.

True international language appeared in depths of technologies used nowadays. As far as their source codes are available for reading (i.e. TCP/IP protocol), instructions to computer and derived programs are creating true international language of nowadays. This reservoir of knowledge shared freely is a true breakthrough in human history. The internet revolution and so called informational society is happening not only at the _surface_ of web-browsers (what is called the Internet mostly nowadays), but very structurally under the hood. Open standards in form of programming languages are creating common ground for human thoughts.




##notes:
- you can program just what you can understand (really?)
- metamorphosis based on context of program (killing machines, art installations, stock-exchange algorithms)
- free culture as a necessity for all the education (free software as a model for all human creation)
- problems of rewards and sustainability of free culture movement (volunteers and philanthropists)
- If there is any unit in informational society it is not _bit_, but *person*.
- and more to write..
