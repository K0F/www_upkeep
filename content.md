#An ode to collapse

Catastrophes are often perceived as cataclysmic series of events leading to some radical changes. Some of them are predictable some happens suddenly without any previous signs. But every time we call something catastrophe, the phenomena is named by general terms or even unique names. This general sum of observations helps us to absorb its impact.

The space in-between such dramatic events could be reflected later on as an era. In certain sense catastrophes end collapses of some underlying systems are needed for naming the whole episodes of human history. Collapse of some of the principles which were present are in fact very creative moments when the new system arises. The greatest collapses often follows a complete paradigmatic shift...

#The change and total recording

All the matter and energy is in constant motion. It is unstoppable and even capturing or precisely documenting any processes are not leaving its framework. We might think that sound recording or photography freezes the time, but it is not very exact. The same time and energy is needed for our perception to read it. Light needs to be reflected towards our eyes and vibrations of air pressure delivers sound to our ears. Information itself is the change from non-information and therefore it needs any change in state.

We might think and even hope for something to be fixed in the universe, a hunt for formulas able to describe certain behaviour is evident. Bud even this description needs extremely plastic matter to read a meaning. The human brain reading and understanding a formula or this text needs to perform billions of operations casting about 30 watts of energy powered by body's owns reserves.

In the way, all organisms needs a constant flow of energy thought their bodies to operate. And there is no way how to step out of this circle keeping organism alive. An idea of an information floating above this all is not only wrong but completely misleading. Recording of an events do not create second universe, but a reflection within itself. All known means of capturing process is just creating an illusion of repeating of an event, what a horrible mistake.

There is nothing repeating at all, everything just flows by its complex paths and what we can is to observe it at maximum. This glorious victory of nature is all absorbing and any revolution of mind or any other matter cannot break the rules. We may split the atom and observe wild dance of energy released but we are unable to change rules how this will happen. There are islands of predictable matter in our CPUs able to behave deterministic, so we are probably able to calculate all its possible states to even distant future, but even such understanding of one laboratory don't break the laws.

#A dream of unified world of human thought _(draft)_


We are witnesses of very unique process, which happens for very first time of human history. The incidences of this act of spreading logical infrastructure are unknown, but its scale is enormous.

Dominance of English language as a world-wide common speech is quite evident nowadays. The interconnected network founded and spread recently (roughly in past 20 years) made this fact even more manifest. Technology acts a new era colonization tool and spreads into last depths of human culture. A soft discreet reality cannot be observed without proper devices but it is starting to be present in physical one. The division of two start to dissolve as a motives ideas and thoughts cannot be separated from what we usually gets form physical world natively.

A single thought (say, set of information) can be technically spread with speed of light around a globe and it can be available in any reachable point. What is a necessity for being part of this info-sphere is a proper reading/writing device which can operate on standards of communication. A number of such devices increases rapidly but the general diversity of use is heavily decreasing. 

All this we probably know already, but there is something underlying this strange phenomena.

True international language appeared in depths of technologies used nowadays. As far as their source codes are available for reading (i.e. TCP/IP protocol), instructions to computer and derived programs are creating true international language of nowadays. This enormous reservoir of all knowledge translated into common computer language is true breakthrough in human history. The internet revolution and so called informational society is happening not only at the _surface_ of web-browsers (what we call the Internet mostly nowadays), but very structurally under the hood. Open standards in form of programming languages are creating common ground for all kind human thoughts. The number of massive standardization can possibly lead into better understanding of all nuances of connected (and educated) human mind and promises completely new level of collaboration across the whole world.

Free (or libre) software development is one of brightest examples of such creative collaboration. What it teaches us is, how wonderful could the world be if we could bridge a *Babylon confusion*. Adopting a technical language is not that new phenomena by itself. Nature sciences tried to achieve the very goal by defining an artificial semantic structures of mathematics. Formal systems that could lay a common ground for any logical consequences. As is was formulated and put together on very same basis and a computer (the machine of thought) had evolved into general computational machine. Nowadays with a help of more democratized encyclopedias of the laws of nature, some deterministic processes, recently even chemical and biological are being translated into computer language, the mathematics of nowadays. What more, within a second it could alter a human brain with speed of light around the globe or even beyond it.
