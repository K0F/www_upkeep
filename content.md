#A dream of unified world of human thought _(draft)_

text in progress..
<!--

We are witnesses of very unique process, which happens for very first time of human history. The incidences of this act of spreading logical infrastructure are unknown, but its scale is enormous.

Dominance of English language as a world-wide common speech is quite evident nowadays. The interconnected network founded and spread recently (roughly in past 20 years) made this fact even more manifest. Technology acts a new era colonisation tool and spreads into last depths of human culture. A soft discreet reality cannot be observed without proper devices but it is starting to be present in physical one. The division of two start to dissolve as a motives ideas and thoughts cannot be separated from what we usually gets form physical world natively.

Thought can be technically spread with speed of light around a globe and it can be available in any reachable point. What is a necessity for being part of this techo-sphere is a proper reading/writing device which can operate on standards of communication. A number of such devices increases rapidly but the general diversity of use is heavily decreasing. 

All this we know already, but there is something notable underlying this strange phenomena.

True international language appeared in depths of technologies used nowadays. As far as their source codes are available for reading (i.e. TCP/IP protocol), instructions to computer and derived programs are creating true international language of nowadays. This reservoir of knowledge shared freely is a true breakthrough in human history. The internet revolution and so called informational society is happening not only at the _surface_ of web-browsers (what is called the Internet mostly nowadays), but very structurally under the hood. Open standards in form of programming languages are creating common ground for human thoughts.




##notes:
- you can program just what you can understand (really?)
- metamorphosis based on context of program (killing machines, art installations, stock-exchange algorithms)
- free culture as a necessity for all the education (free software as a model for all human creation)
- problems of rewards and sustainability of free culture movement (volunteers and philanthropists)
- If there is any unit in informational society it is not _bit_, but *person*.
- more to write..
